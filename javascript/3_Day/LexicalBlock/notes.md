Lexical scope defines the accessibility of variables and functions depending on their location in the source code. Variables and functions have different levels of scope:

Global Scope: Variables defined outside any function or block, accessible anywhere in the program.
Local Scope: Variables defined inside a function or block, accessible only within that specific function or block.
Nested Scope: Inner functions have access to variables in their parent functions.
Block Scope: Variables defined with let and const are limited to the block they are declared in, like loops or conditionals.
